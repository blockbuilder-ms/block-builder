# Readme (Under construction)

This package does not use jQuery, this is a choice made in the wish to make a slim codebase as possible.
Instead it loads only the functionality it needs to run for the segments of code called from the dom markup.

### Getting Started

To use this segment use the pre compiled file.
Make edits to functionality through a plugin and hooks.

### Extending

You can get an overview of the possible ways of extending the javascript framework.

#### Modules

Allows you to add modules, which will be loaded dynamicly when needed and adds an action entry to run different functionality on that module in question.

`Allowing for complex and deep extensions.`

#### Actions

Allows you to run a segment of code at a certain junction in runtime.
It works much like a slim version of the hooks in Wordpress.

#### Filters

Allows for dynamic value filtering in the areas it's used, which allows for dynamic modifications of certain areas.
